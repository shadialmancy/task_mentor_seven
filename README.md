# task_mentor_seven

A Task Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is created for mentor seven.

## Project Feature

- There is a wishlist for the items you like.
- Add product to shopping cart, wishlist.
- User also can search by product name, and filter by latest added product and lowest price.

## Problem solved

- making user search for any item and filter by latest or newest added product and lowest or highest price-
- making user add product and the product isnt duplicated in the cart, instead if user wants more of the same item, user can change quantity in the cart page.
- users can access their wishlist and add or remove my pressing the heart icon.
- organizing the state between each page by using bloc state management.

## What did i learn?
- I learned more about state management using bloc.
- I learned more about customizing the UI design and make it more efficient.
